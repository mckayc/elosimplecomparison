General Overview:

Create a web app that uses the ELO ranking system to compare different items to determine which item is best or has the highest score. The app will be called "ELO Simple Comparison" Front end will be html and backend will be python. Please make it so this can be run locally or be run in docker with a yaml file that can be pasted into Portainer.

Overall Style and look:

This webapp should look similar to Google news. The main content should be centered on the page and have a dark theme with white text. The background  of the main content should be dark gray and the background for the rest of the page should be light gray. Have each title be a larger font and underneat that have horizontal rules to devide the content. The main content should be in a box with rounded corners. Buttons should have rounded corners and have a lighter gray color for the background with white text. Use a style.css file to do all the formatting.

Page breakdowns:

index.html - This page will display the title of this app on top. Under that is a text box with instructions to list 3 or more items on each row. Under that is a submit button. When this page is loaded, all previous data entered is removed so that the user can start with fresh data. If the user lists duplicate items, please ignore the duplicates. If the user enters fewer than 3 items, give them a warning telling them they must enter 3 or more items and stay on that page until they list 3 or more items.

compare.html - This page will list two of the entered items randomly side by side. Under each item will be a button that says "Vote". Once the user presses "Vote" two more random items will be listed. Each item should be compared with two other items. When voting is finished the user should be taken to the results page. The ELO ranking system will be used to determine the scores as items are being voted on.

results.html - The results pages should list all items with their ELO scores. Under the score should be two buttons: "Vote again" and "Start over". Vote again will take the user back to the compare page and keep the same items but reset the ELO scores. The Start over button will take the user back to the index.html page and reset both the items and the ELO scores.

readme.md - This should be a file will instructions for this app that can be uploaded to Github. This file should explain what the app does and it should have instructions for installing and running this app locally. It should also have instructions for uploading to Github and include a Docker yaml file that can be pasted to Portainer so that a user could easily install this on Docker and host it themselves.
